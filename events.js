It was much faster then previous computers and was used to calculate complex mathematical problems, such as the feasibility of thermonuclear weapons. Additionally, all six programmers of the ENIAC were women, who were chosen from a group of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania. These women were some of the first computer programmers, and needed to know a great deal of mathematics, circuitry, and machinery.",
